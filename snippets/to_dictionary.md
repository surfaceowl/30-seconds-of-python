Combines two lists into a dictionary, where the elements of the first one serve as the keys and the elements of the second one serve as the values.
The values of the first list need to be unique and hashable.

Use `zip()` in combination with a list comprehension to combine the values of the two lists, based on their positions.

```py
def to_dictionary(keys, values):
  return {key:value for key, value in zip(keys, values)}
```

```py
to_dictionary(['a', 'b'], [1, 2]) # { a: 1, b: 2 }
```
